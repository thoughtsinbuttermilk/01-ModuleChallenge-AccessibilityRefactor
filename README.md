# Northwestern Full Stack Development Bootcamp Assignment 01

# Project description

The goal of this project is to refactor an existing website to be compliant with accessibility standards and tools. The original source code was provided as part of the assignment. The requirement is to refactor the sources without changing the useability or display of the site. This assignment is due Monday, 05 June (12:59 p.m.). 

## User story
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines.

## Acceptance criteria (_requirements_)
Given a webpage meets accessibility standards:
* When I view the source code, then I find semantic HTML elements.
* When I view the structure of the HTML elements, then I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
* When I view the image elements, then I find accessible alt attributes.
* When I view the heading attributes, then they fall in sequential order.
* When I view the title element, then I find a concise, descriptive title.

## Notes for Instructor, Teaching Assistants

The source code for this project is in the `main` branch. I have not deleted the working branches I used to iterate over the changes, organize the project etc., in case those are of interest to you.

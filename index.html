TODOs
2. consolidate duplication in css
3. update css selectors (not needed)
4. make image names unique
5. add alt attributes to images, NOTE: no external links in the document
7. increase contrast of background / foreground colors NOTE: not sure about this one since the visual appearance is to stay the same.
DONE
8. Sectioning elements and screen readers: https://www.accessibilityoz.com/2020/02/html5-sectioning-elements-and-screen-readers/
1. eliminate "div soup", replace with semantic elements
6. figure out what to do about hero image in css? move to html and add aria? something else?
Something else...see below, don't know if that's correct but VoiceOver does read the alt text for the image
9. Add <span>, aria-label to heart emoji in footer
10. Copyright symbol is read correctly, no label needed

            <p>

Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
